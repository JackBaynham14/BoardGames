This game will be built using a Board Object and a Main Game Loop. The board object will hold all
data on the board including the location of pieces and whose turn is next. It will also contain
methods for interacting with the board by placing pieces, looking up the makeup of the board,
and looking up game status. The Main Loop with call these methods appropriately.

Board Object:
    - Simulates a checkers board by storing information about the board and providing methods to 
        interact with it.
    
    Private Fields:
        - 2D list representing game board
        - current player
    
    Private Methods:
        - initialization
            - generate board
            - assign player
            - set game status to ongoing
        - check_move
            - checks a possible move to see if valid
        - check_game_status
            - updates game status based on board
    
    Public Methods:
        - info 
            - returns board layout, current player, and game status
        - move
            - input validation (check_move)
            - places current player's piece at inputed spot
            - switches players
            - check and update game status (check_game_status)

GUI Module:
    - Handles graphical input and output for the program. Initializes the graphics object and
        handles interpreting keyboard/mouse actions. Also updates the GUI to match the board
        status.
    
Networking Module:
    - TBD

Main Loop:
    - Calls the methods to interact with the checkers board object and other modules such as gui
        input and output and networking input and output.

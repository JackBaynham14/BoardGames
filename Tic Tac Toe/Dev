This game will be built using a Board Object and a Main Game Loop. The board object will hold all
data on the board including the location of pieces and whose turn is next. It will also contain
methods for interacting with the board by placing pieces, looking up the makeup of the board,
and looking up game status. The Main Loop with call these methods appropriately.

Board Object:
    - Simulates a checkers board by storing information about the board and providing methods to 
        interact with It
    
    Private Fields:
        - 2D list representing game board
        - current player
    
    Private Methods:
        - initialization
            - generate board
            - assign player
            - set game status to ongoing
        - check_move
            - checks a possible move to see if valid
        - check_game_status
            - updates game status based on board
    
    Public Methods:
        - info 
            - returns board layout, current player, and game status
        - move

            - switches players
            - check and update game status (check_game_status)

Main Loop:
    - Calls the methods to interact with the checkers board object and other modules such as gui
        input and output and networking input and output
